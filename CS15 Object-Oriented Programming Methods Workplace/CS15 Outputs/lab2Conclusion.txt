1. Yes you can write str[10] to a new value.
2. No because pstr is a constant string literal.
3. Yes you can change pstr to a different string.
4. Yes but only element by element.
5. qstr will point to the old string.
6. No because str is a constant pointer to the base of the array.
7. The 6th element of str will be changed.
8. rstr will reflect the changes to str.
9. pstr will print the whole string, *pstr will point to the base of the array, and (void *)pstr will give you the address to the base of the array.
