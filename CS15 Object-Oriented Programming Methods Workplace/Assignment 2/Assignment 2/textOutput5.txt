the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their party.
all i want for christmas is my two front teeth.
the quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog.
the world is in a crisis.
we must stand together as one and fight the oppression.
we have little time so wake up and stand strong.
our way of life cannot change because of one man.
what does the fox say.
we have the right to say anything and everything we please.
no one can stop a motived being if they are already so far ahead in their journey.
we gotta start making changes.
