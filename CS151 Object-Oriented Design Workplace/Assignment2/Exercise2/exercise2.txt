Primitive data type int is faster to work with and takes up less memory but does
not offer any functionalities other than arithmetic operations such as:
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo.

Class Integer is not as fast to work with as int and takes up more space but it
offers more functionalities than primitive int. Since Java collections frameworks
saves objects we wouldn't be able to store primitive int so Integer would have
to be used instead. Class Integer offer many functionalities such as:
• hashCode() - returns a hash code for an integer
• Methods to cast an integer value to double, float, short, and long.
• Methods that manipulate the binary representation of an integer such as rotateRight(),
rotateLeft(), etc.
• parseInt(String s) - Parsing a string to obtain an integer value.
etc.
